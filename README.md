# 🏰 Tower Defense Unity Game

A 2D tower defense prototype developed in Unity.

Players must strategically place towers on a 10x10 grid to stop waves of enemies from reaching the central base. Towers automatically fire at nearby enemies and can be upgraded for greater damage. Enemies spawn from random edges of the map, and the game ends in victory if all waves are cleared — or in defeat if the base is overrun.
